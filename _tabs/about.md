Iâ€™m a penetration tester with a focus on infrastructure, web, API, and mobile security also Maldev. With a sharp eye for exploiting vulnerabilities, I work in the shadows to break defenses, leaving no system untouched. Every attack is executed with precision and purpose, as I push the limits of whatâ€™s possible in security testing.

I thrive on uncovering weaknesses, exploiting flaws, and ensuring that every exploit is carried out to perfection. My goal is simple: to break&expose weaknesses before the enemy does, with a devilish touchðŸ˜ˆ.
