  <summary>In this post, I’m going to share four challenges I created for the Penforce Internship CTF Competition. The goal of these challenges was to give participants hands-on experience with different security concepts, ranging from web vulnerabilities to tricky bypass techniques. Each challenge was designed not only to test problem-solving skills but also to highlight real-world attack surfaces that s...</summary>

  <summary>Blind Trust  Hello everyone, It’s been a while since I published a write-up. In this one, I’m going to show you how I managed to solve a web challenge that had zero solves during Arab War Games CTF 2025. Unfortunately, I didn’t solve it during the competition, but I was the only one who was very close said by the author.    First Part  Creating an account  Let’s start by examining the applicati...</summary>

  <summary>Introduction In this blog post, I’ll explore how adversaries conceal their shellcode inside Portable Executable (PE) files—particularly in sections like .rsrc—to evade Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems and antivirus software. By embedding malicious code within legitimate-looking executables, attackers can bypass signature-based detection mechanisms and make analysis more challenging...</summary>

  <summary>Introduction I would like to write a write-up about a machine I solved on TryHackMe called Vulnnet:Roasted, which is an Active Directory machine. My focus will not be on how I solved the machine, but rather on explaining the tools and techniques I used to solve it. Before I start, I would like to say that this is my first write-up, so please forgive any mistakes and I hope someone benefits from...</summary>
